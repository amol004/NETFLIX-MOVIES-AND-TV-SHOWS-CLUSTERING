# Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to group Netflix's content according to site data. Clustering the video content would not only help construct an effective recommendation system but also reveal what kind of content the company is interested in displaying on its website. Providing filmmakers and content developers with an understanding of the kind of video content that consumers want.
